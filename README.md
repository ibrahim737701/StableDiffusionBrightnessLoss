# StableDiffusionBrightnessLoss

This project uses stable diffusion to generate images. 

We replace the embeddings of the word 'puppy' with another learned embedding from huggingface.
We also create a 'brightness loss' which forces the model to steer towards brighter generations.

Below are some examples:-
# Prompts for all the images are - "A mouse in the style of puppy"
Where puppy is replaces by each learned embedding listed below
